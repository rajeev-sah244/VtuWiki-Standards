#VtuWiki Recommends use of git and github for code revisions.
- As observed at VTU affiliated colleges, every semester new lab manuals are prepared by concerned departments and professors. 
- To avoid the pain and efforts taken by Professors and to provide less error prone *quality* code, 
VtuWiki recommends use of git/github for code revision. 
Git has been a proven code revision tool for years and powers most major open source software projects, including Linux, android, Wikipedia, etc.
